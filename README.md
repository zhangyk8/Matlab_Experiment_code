# Matlab Course Codes (SYSU, Fall 2017)

    This repository has my Matlab codes for experiment reports of the Matlab course at the School of Mathematics, Sun Yat-sen University. The official name of this course is "Mathematical Experiments and Mathematical Software". Feel free to download my code or folk the repository. If you have any questions about the codes, do not hesitate to contact me.
